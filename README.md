# Portfolio Heatmap Generator
With this tool, you can input the the tickers in your investment portfolio along with the daily change of the corresponding investment, and see the investments pan out onto a Heatmap.

# What is a "Heatmap?"
A heat map (or heatmap) is a data visualization technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions. The variation in color may be by hue or intensity, giving obvious visual cues to the reader about how the phenomenon is clustered or varies over space.

# Why is this useful? 
This tool is very useful to vizualize how your portfolio is doing at any given time.

# What type of investments are compatible with this?
This tool supports any investment with a variable value, such as stocks, ETFs, Forex, commodities, etc.

# Live Demo
You can find a live demo of this project at https://nikzral.github.io/portfolio-heatmap-generator.github.io/

# What can I expect in the future?
In future renditions of this tool, we will add support for the following issues:

  -Grouping up investments into groups in the Heatmap (i.e. having a specific section in the Heatmap for finance stocks)
  
  -Being able to simply input the ticker, and not the change. The tool would fetch change.
  
  -Being able to have more than 10 investments in the map at a time.
  
  -Make the website responsive.
  
  
Thanks to Muyiwa Olurin for the Heatmapper!
